> How to Get the Game
OPTION 1: Visit the provided Website URL
OPTION 2: Visit the Google Drive link and select "Download all". Unzip the file once downloaded, and run "index.html" in a browser of your choice

> How to Run
-If playing a local downloaded version, make sure all files are contained in one folder, or it will not work
-Game should run on most common browsers
-Game MAY work on mobile devices in landscape orientation, depending on screen size, but was not built to do so
-If the game appears too small, zoom in the page, but try to keep the entire game screen in view
 (starting game screen will be grey, blank sections on webpage have been left white)
-Click the "PLAY" button to start, and follow the game instructions from there
-Game progress is not saved. Reloading the page will restart your progress


>Common issues
-NOTE: This game is a prototype, and may not always run as expected

-Within the location "Point Pleasant Park", the "go left/right" options do not work. Clicking on them will do nothing,
 and you can still access the regular map after doing so
-Some locations are not working, but are still available for the ID to spawn in. If the Student ID does not appear in any location, 
 please reload the page and try again

> Questions/Issues
